## Secure Journal Expo App

This repository now includes **SecureJournal**, an offline-first Expo starter app that uses biometric authentication and Argon2id-derived keys to encrypt all journal entries before saving them to local SQLite storage.

### Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the development server: `npm start`
3. Use your device's biometric sensor to unlock the journal, choose a passphrase, and begin writing entries.

Entries never leave your device and remain encrypted at rest for privacy.
